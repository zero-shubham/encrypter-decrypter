This project was not a successful one by me and has been left out. Read the documentations to get inner an idea of the project.
For surfacial idea, this project was an attempt to encode plain text from present character set mapping by just manipulating the mapping. It asked for a six digit code and encoded accordingly.
Read documentaions to know about the short-cummings and make necessary changes to make this project use worthy if possible.





#.xmind format can be opened by Xmind mapping application.
